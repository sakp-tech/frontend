// BFS - Def
/**
 * BFS or Breath First Search is an Algorithm which is
 * used to find if there is a path and if there is then what is the shorted path in unweighted graph.
 */

// BFS - DS
/**
 * To implement BFS we need two Data Structures: Queue and Hash Table
 * Queue: To check the nodes in specific order(FIFO).
 * Hash Table: To maintain relation between nodes
